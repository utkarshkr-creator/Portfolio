        I caught fire coding. <br/>
        <br/>

I always thought my dream was to be a proofreader for an indie publishing company, sipping my caf√© con leche and reading the opening lines to the next best-selling vampire novel. I gravitated toward proofreading and quality control positions. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.
<br/>
<br/>
And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I gave my first contest on Code forces. Since then, I can't get enough. Competitive programming calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem-solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code.
<br/>
<br/>
My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, domain-driven design, responsive design principles, website optimization, and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code. So far I have C++, Datastructures and algorithms,  JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
